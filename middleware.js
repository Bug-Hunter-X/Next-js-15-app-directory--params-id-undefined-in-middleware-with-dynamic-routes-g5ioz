In Next.js 15, an uncommon error can occur when using the `app` directory with dynamic routes and middleware. If you have a route like `/users/[id]`, and you try to access the `params.id` in your middleware, it might be `undefined` even if a valid ID is provided. This is because the middleware runs before the request is fully resolved.  The solution requires restructuring the middleware logic to fetch the data or handle this situation gracefully. For instance, using a conditional check or handling the missing parameter explicitly.
